DP: detector of presuppositions for survey questions

DP questions are designed assumin some underlying questions. For example, if a researcher askes the question, "How long has it been since you graduated from a Masters program?" there is a pressuposition that the individual being surveyed actually graduated from a Masters program. Another example, take from the actual procrastantion survey, is: "I put off making decisions until itâ€™s too late." The presupposition here is that the surveyers makes decision. Although this is straight-forward in this example, there are usally two concerns with DPs: The question can be difficult to answer and secondly if the assupmtions are incorrect people feel obliged to ansswer, which could lead to survey bias.
