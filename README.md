SWLS: Satisfied With Life Scale 

SWLS is typically a concise 5-item insturment used to underantd and measure global cognitice judgements pertaining to the satification of a participants time. These survey questions do not weight the imporatnce of any one particular area of an individuals life, but rather allow individuals to factor in all aspects of thier life. An example used in the procrastination survey, "I am satisfied with my life" doesn't ask about a specific aspect, but rather a broad representation.
