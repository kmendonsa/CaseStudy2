Procrastination - A global view

Survey questionnaire types: DP, AIP, GP, and SWLS

DP: detector of presuppositions for survey questions

DP questions are designed assumin some underlying questions. For example, if a researcher askes the question, "How long has it been since you graduated from a Masters program?" there is a pressuposition that the individual being surveyed actually graduated from a Masters program. Another example, take from the actual procrastantion survey, is: "I put off making decisions until itâ€™s too late." The presupposition here is that the surveyers makes decision. Although this is straight-forward in this example, there are usally two concerns with DPs: The question can be difficult to answer and secondly if the assupmtions are incorrect people feel obliged to ansswer, which could lead to survey bias.

SWLS: Satisfied With Life Scale 

SWLS is typically a concise 5-item insturment used to underantd and measure global cognitice judgements pertaining to the satification of a participants time. These survey questions do not weight the imporatnce of any one particular area of an individuals life, but rather allow individuals to factor in all aspects of thier life. An example used in the procrastination survey, "I am satisfied with my life" doesn't ask about a specific aspect, but rather a broad representation.
