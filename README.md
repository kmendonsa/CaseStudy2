Survey questionnaire types: DP, AIP, GP, and SWLS

DP: Decisoinal Procrastination Scale 

This scale is often regarded as the only reliable measure of indecision. The objective of this method is to measure the the tendency of participants to put off decisions by some other task or activity. An example used in this survey includes, "I don’t make decisions unless I really have to."

AIP: Adult Inventory of Procrastination 

The AIP measures the tendency for individuals to postpone tasks under differing circumstances. It is most often used as a measure of procrastination due to fear, procrastination due to a lack of skills, or procrastination to protect ones self-esteem from failure. Answers are submitted on a 5 point scale: (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Examples of qeustions include, “I am not very good at meeting deadlines.”

SWLS: Satisfied With Life Scale 

SWLS is typically a concise 5-item insturment used to underantd and measure global cognitice judgements pertaining to the satification of a participants time. These survey questions do not weight the imporatnce of any one particular area of an individuals life, but rather allow individuals to factor in all aspects of thier life. An example used in the procrastination survey, "I am satisfied with my life" doesn't ask about a specific aspect, but rather a broad representation.
